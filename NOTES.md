# Notes

- [x] animated fish in bubble
  - [x] animate bubble/fish group to move along path
    - I've abandoned this for now - requires a mesh to be animated on the path, and when I tried grabbing the coords from a cube that was moving along the path, I couldn't get real values. I'll hack around this for now.
  - [x] animate fish along central axis (e.g. change transform origin outside the bubble and rotate around it to look like swimming in a circle)
- [x] bridge or land mass fish can swim around
  - [x] textures for realism
  - consider more complex example than just a plane (e.g. plane w/ notches cut out, inside of cylinder with parts missing, Blender-modeled fragmented tunnel, etc.)
- [x] good-enough lighting
  - [ ] refined lighting
- [ ] other swimmers
  - koi
  - school of fish
  - jelly fish bobbing up/down
- [ ] aquarium misc. decor
